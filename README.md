# Generalized_Data_Structures_Library
The aim of this project is to create a library with generic, object-oriented implementations of major data structures,
offering ready-to-use fundamental and advanced operations for both linear and non-linear structures, adaptable to any data type.

### PLATFORM REQUIRED :   
```Windows Platform Or Linux Distributions.```
### ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENT :  
```INTEL 32 Bit Processor Or Higher.```
### USER INTERFACE :             
```Command Line Interface```
### TECHNOLOGY USED : 
```C++ Programming.```
 
### About :
  - This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structure.
  - We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non linear data strutters in an object oriented way.
  - We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.
  - All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
